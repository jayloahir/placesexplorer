<h3>HISTORY</h3>

<p>    Nainital has historically been a part of the Kumaon region.<br>
    After the fall of Katyuri Dynasty in 10th century, Kumaon was divided into several small princely states, and the region around Nainital was under various branches of a Khasiya family.<br>
     The first dynasty to achieve consolidated dominance over Kumaon after the Katyuris was the Chand dynasty, but it took many centuries and Nainital and its surroundings were one of the last areas to be absorbed.<br> <p>
     Trilok Chand had built a fort at Bhimtal in the thirteenth century, But at that time, Nainital itself was not under the Chand rule, and was situated near the western border of the Kingdom.<br>
      During the reign of Udyan Chand, the western boundary of the Chand kingdom extended to the Koshi and Suyal rivers, but Ramgarh and Kota were still under the former Khasia rule.<br>
       Kirat Chand, who ruled from 1488 to 1503 was finally able to establish authority over Nainital and the surrounding region.<br><p>
        The Khasia chiefs made an attempt to regain their independence in 1560, when they enjoyed a brief moment of success under the leadership of a Khasiya of Ramgarh, but were later subdued with ruthlessness by Balo Kalyan Chand.</p>

            When sound of exhilaration seems to be coming far above from sky and only colorful para-gliders could be spotted above head, the site is most probably Solang Valley of Manali Hill Station, <br>
            which has a uniqueness that stands out from any other paragliding site in India. <br>
             What more this is one facet of this hill city, like honeymooner trying to pose wearing ski gears rather than actually willing to try the fun of skiing.  <br>
             Add to that elders on some sort of minor pilgrimage to various temples in Manali, individual getting holy dip in hot water springs, families bonding in picnic spots and many other images, and this hill city comes alive in front of eyes. <br>
<p>
A part of Beas River Valley, Manali is situated at an altitude of more than 2000 m from where the eyes fall on the views of forests, orchards, river, mountains ranges and more, for nothing but sheer visual delight.  <br>
The place once used to serve trade purposes via Manal - Leh route; now the same route is used for the purpose of adventure mainly for the bikers and jeep riders. <br>
Having invitingly secured its history in its name, Manali is associated with legends of King Manu who had the responsibility to protect human civilization after the great flood meant to destroy the world; which he successfully shouldered. <br> If unfolding stories entwined in myths and legend is a loved way to spend holidays, Manali rouses the need to explore the Himalayas with even more intensity. <br>
<p>
Spirit of tourism is far from fading even after the consequence of popularity.  <br>
Be it pleasantly cool months or duration of snowfall during the New Year or Christmas, this hill destination is revered by everyone with the intention or for the experience of Manali tourism.   <br>    

Situated near the end of valley, Manali is one of the most attractive tourist spot not only of Himachal Pradesh, but of International fame also. Manali is synonymous streams and birdsong, forests and orchards and grandees of snow-capped mountains.
<p>
Manali is the real starting point of an ancient trade route which crosses the Rohtang and Baralacha passes, and runs via Lahul and Ladakh to Kashmir while divergent road connects it with Spiti. <br>
Now the motor link have been provided up to Leh in Jammu & Kashmir, Pangi valley in Chamba and Kaza of Lahul & Spiti.<br>
 There are regular bus services to these places from Manali during summer season. It is situated at a distance of 45 kms from Kullu.<br>

There is an interesting legend about Manali which goes to say that Manu, the author of ’Manu Samhita’, after the great deluge first stepped on the earth from the celestial boat at a place in this land. <br>
The particular spot where he established his abode was the present Manali which is regarded as the changed name of ’Manu-Alaya’, the abode of Manu.<br>
 The temple dedicated to Manu is still existing in the Manali village.<br>
